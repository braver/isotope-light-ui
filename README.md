# Isotope UI theme

A clean and configurable UI theme that adapts to your taste, offering endless possibilities. One Atom, many Isotopes ;)

Isotope relies on syntax-variables.less to set a background color, and derives all other colors from that. It's intended to provide an easy-on-the-eyes backdrop for your code, with well balanced typography, whitespace and contrast.

It's also flexible: you can configure typography, background (images even) and a number of other options to your liking.

Thanks to [@simurai](https://github.com/simurai) for the work on the [one-dark-ui](https://github.com/atom/one-dark-ui) theme that Isotope was forked from.

## Configuration

- Choose from a number of fonts included in this theme

- Or even use any image as background (from your computer or [the internets](http://hubblesite.org))
- Make the layout take up less vertical space (e.g. for small screens)
- Choose tree-view highlight color
- Style the gutter, or not
- Choose low contrast tooltips (or fancy colorful ones)
- Change font-sizes for the entire UI (everything will scale to fit) by putting this in your stylesheet:

```
html, body { font-size: 9px; }
```
