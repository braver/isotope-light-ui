# Isotope Light UI theme

This is a light fork of [isotope-ui](https://atom.io/themes/isotope-ui).

A UI theme that offers endless possibilities: one Atom, many Isotopes ;) Isotope adapts to match any syntax theme and you can change its appearance quite extensively. It provides an easy-on-the-eyes backdrop for your code, with well balanced typography, whitespace and contrast.

## Features

- Automatically adapts to your favourite syntax theme
- Looks awesome in [Zen](https://atom.io/packages/Zen)
- Configurable!


## Configuration

- Choose from a number of fonts included in this theme, or match the editor's font. Multiple font-weights are available.
- Choose between a flat or gradient background.
- Or even use any image as background (from your computer or [the internets](http://hubblesite.org)).
- Choose low contrast tooltips (or fancy colorful ones).
- Choose a more spacious layout for your 27"
- Change font-sizes for the entire UI (everything will scale to fit) by putting this in your stylesheet:

```
html, body { font-size: 9px; }
```
