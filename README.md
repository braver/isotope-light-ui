# Isotope Light UI theme

A light fork of [isotope-light-ui](https://atom.io/themes/isotope-light-ui).

A clean and configurable UI theme that adapts to your taste, offering endless possibilities. One Atom, many Isotopes ;) Isotope bases its colors on the selected syntax theme and blends with all of them.

It's intended to provide an easy-on-the-eyes backdrop for your code, with well balanced typography, whitespace and contrast.

Thanks to [@simurai](https://github.com/simurai) for the work on the [one-dark-ui](https://github.com/atom/one-dark-ui) theme that Isotope was forked from.

## Configuration

**You may need to reload atom before settings become available ([settings-view #347](https://github.com/atom/settings-view/issues/347))**

- Choose from a number of fonts included in this theme or match the editor's font.
- Select hip 'thin' fonts, or trusty old 'regular'
- Choose between a flat or gradient background.
- Or even use any image as background (from your computer or [the internets](http://hubblesite.org)).
- Make the layout take up less vertical space (e.g. for small screens).
- Choose low contrast tooltips (or fancy colorful ones).
- Change font-sizes for the entire UI (everything will scale to fit) by putting this in your stylesheet:

```
html, body { font-size: 9px; }
```
